## Ruined Mending

A spiritual successor to LitharsMending by DigitalZombie: https://github.com/DigitalzombieTLD/LitharsMending

Allows to repair ruined clothing items. It will automatically chose the worst condition Sewing Kit and then the worst condition Tackle when restoring clothes.

At the moment, when you go to restore a ruined clothing item, it will just cost 2 cloths but I will have that updated to more realistic values here in a day or two.

Requires:
- ModSettings
